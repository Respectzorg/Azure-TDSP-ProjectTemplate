 # TDSP Project Structure, and Documents and Artifact Templates

This is a personlized version of the project directory structure for Team Data Science Process developed by Microsoft. It contains templates for various documents that are recommended as part of executing a data science project when using TDSP for DDI project at Respect.

This repository should be used as a template for each new use case.

**NOTE:** This template is still in development in order to better suit Respects environment and ways of working. Therefore the folder structure and documents found, might change over time and vary from TDSP.

## What is TDSP?

[Team Data Science Process (TDSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview) is an agile, iterative, data science methodology to improve collaboration and team learning. It is supported through a lifecycle definition, standard project structure, artifact templates, and [tools](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-Utilities) for productive data science. 


**NOTE:** In this directory structure, the **Sample_Data folder is NOT supposed to contain LARGE raw or processed data**. It is only supposed to contain **small and sample** data sets, which could be used to test the code.

The two documents under Docs/Project, namely the [Charter](./Docs/Project/Charter.md) and [Exit Report](./Docs/Project/Exit%20Report.md) are particularly important to consider. They help to define the project at the start of an engagement, and provide a final report to the customer or client. As of now there are alternative versions of these documents within Respect, therefore not used in this template.

**NOTE:** When a project is considered more time consuming and demanding the TDSP has more artifacts and documents to be used in order to deliver a good data science project.
