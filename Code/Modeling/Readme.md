# This folder contains code for modeling and related activities (such as feature engineering, model evaluation etc.)

Notebooks ready for deployment will be stored in this folder. [Papermill](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will be used to parameterize and execute these notebooks. Other notebooks should be placed in the [Data_Exploration](https://github.com/Respectzorg/DDI-TDSP-ProjectTemplate/tree/master/Docs/Data_Exploration) folder.

## Output folder is a location for temporary outputs of the modeling stage

Purpose of this folder is to have a place to write to without effecting the git repository to keep it clean. All files contained in this folder will therefore not be added to the git repository as this folder is added to the gitignore file.
