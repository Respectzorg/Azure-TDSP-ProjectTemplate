# This folder hosts code for data acquisition and understanding (exploratory analysis)

Within this folder you can find SQL-files and notebooks that are used to find information about which data needs to be gathered and how it should be processed. These files are not used to explain or showcase the data properties. A proper explaination can be found in [this document](https://github.com/Respectzorg/DDI-TDSP-ProjectTemplate/tree/master/Docs/Data_Understanding.md).

## Output folder is a location for temporary outputs of the exploration stage

Purpose of this folder is to have a place to write to without effecting the git repository to keep it clean. All files contained in this folder will therefore not be added to the git repository as this folder is added to the gitignore file.
