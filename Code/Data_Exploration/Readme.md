# This folder hosts code for data acquisition and understanding (exploratory analysis)

Within this folder you can find SQL-files and notebooks that are used to find information about which data needs to be gathered and how it should be processed. These files are not used to explain or showcase the data properties. A proper explaination can be found in [this document](https://github.com/Respectzorg/DDI-TDSP-ProjectTemplate/tree/master/Docs/Data_Understanding.md).
